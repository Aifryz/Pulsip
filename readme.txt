Pulsip
======
Pulsip is a SFML/C++ game framework made to be used during Ludum Dare compo and/or jam.
It's made by Aifryz(Robert Bicz) and it's under a zlib license so feel free to use it in your project.
This framework is nowhere near done.
Features
--------
Right now I've implemented some basic features such as:
-Multi-layer TileMap
-QuadTree for collisions
-Nicer implementation of Rectangle(the SFML version is, let's say less than ideal)
