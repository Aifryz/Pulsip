Pulsip
======
Pulsip is a SFML/C++ framework made for Ludum Dare compo.
It's made by Aifryz(Robert Bicz) and it's under a zlib license so feel free to use it in your project.
This framework is nowhere near done.
Features
--------
Right now I've implemented some basic features such as:
-Animated Sprite
-Basic Entity
-Basic Player controls
-Quad Tree for collision
-very simple Resource Manager

I plan to add at least:
-TileMap
-Level management
-Basic GUI elements
-Particle system

Also I really need to make my code look nicer.
